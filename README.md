Trying watir

## Notes

Instead of manually installing chromedriver per the documentation, use brew:

```bash
brew install chromedriver
```

Same for selenium-server-standalone for opera:

```bash
brew install selenium-server-standalone
```

then add to ~/.exports

```bash
export SELENIUM_SERVER_JAR=/usr/local/opt/selenium-server-standalone/selenium-server-standalone-2.25.0.jar
```
